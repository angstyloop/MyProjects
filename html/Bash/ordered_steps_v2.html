                    This is a note about the code below. If it gets longer than the width of this div element, which is 600px, it should just wrap to the bottom.

                <div class="code">
                    This is a long code snippet. If it gets too long, but we still want it on one line that's fine because we get a horizontal scroll bar.

                    This is another code snippet. <br>
                    We can use line break to put code on multiple lines, and if one line gets longer than 600px we get a scroll bar too. <br>
                    We can still keep using line break.

                    Sometimes we'll want to indent some lines in
                    our code. We can do this simply by nesting
                    &lt;div&gt; tags.
                    <div>This automatically line breaks and indents
                        for us<div> since our stylesheet adds left
                            padding</div> to anything that inherits from 
                        .custom-counter or .code, </div>which makes 
                    indenting lines of code
                        <div>a snap!</div></div>
