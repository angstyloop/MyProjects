// my own notes and a list of things to do

[] Get a dictionary of words.

[] Parse the dictionary into a list of strings.

[] Given a dictionary of words, store the list of contraction partitions for each word
    in a relational database. Maybe look into SQL / MySQL?

[] Given a database of words and their possible contraction, remove contractions
    that are contrary the spirit of braille:
    1. [] word signs
    2. [] ...
    3. [] ...
    ...
