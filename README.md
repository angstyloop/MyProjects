README.md

    A very helpful README file!

codeacademy

    codeacademy-inspired projects

cpp_ads_weiss

    Code examples and solutions
    to exercises from Weiss.

html

    Standalone HTML projects 
    and examples. There are
    a few good tutorials on
    git- and bash-related
    stuff. There is also 
    a neat tutorial on 
    hacking counters in
    CSS.

more_cpp_examples

    Just some miscellaneous
    C++ code. Most of it is
    based on examples from
    the cplusplus website.

scripts

    Various scripts that are
    here because they're
    cool or because I need
    them for my workflow
    when I change machines.

thesis_reservoir_computing

    Most of the code for my
    thesis on reservoir
    computing, a class
    of recurrent neural
    networks. I wrote it
    all in C++ from scratch,
    right down to the matrix
    libraries!

    The rest of the code for
    my thesis is in the 
    dislin directory of my git.
